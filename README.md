Created using C++ and SDL.

**Instructions**

Put your spritesheet in the assets folder. (See desert.png as an example.)

To run it, use the make file. ('make', followed by 'make run') Select a tile from the source in the bottom window (the selected tile will show a dark overlay) and click where to place it in the map. Delete by right clicking on the map.

Save using Ctrl + S, and you will get an output file map.txt in the following format:
